"""The build root is pulled once per run and shared, never pulled per job.

quay.io/fedora/fedora:44 is republished several times a day and each previous
digest is garbage-collected. Three digests died in five days, the last inside
four hours, and Fedora publishes no immutable tag to pin instead. Pinning a
digest and pulling it in every job is therefore a race the factory loses:

  run 34801488576  every job, exit 125, pin written 09-12 and dead by 09-17
  run 35186196830  stages 0-3 pulled at 06:01, stages 4-10 exit 125 at 07:13,
                   from a pin that was correct when the run started

So prepare pulls the tag once, records what it resolved to, and shares the
bytes. These tests hold that shape: nothing may reintroduce a per-job pull, and
a job that runs the image must load it first.
