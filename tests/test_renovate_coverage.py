"""Every container image this factory runs must be tracked by something.

Two pins died in one week -- quay.io/fedora/fedora and quay.io/packit/packit,
the latter twice -- and each took every job in the run down with exit 125
before a line of its script ran. Neither was tracked: Renovate's docker manager
reads Dockerfiles, `container:` and `services:`, and both were named inside a
`docker run` shell line, which no built-in manager scans.

renovate.json now carries a custom manager for that shape. These tests assert
the manager still covers every such pin, so a workflow added later cannot
quietly reintroduce an untracked one.
