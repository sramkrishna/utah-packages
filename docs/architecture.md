```

This factory is GitHub Actions' replacement for Copr. Fedora dist-git supplies
the recipe; the upstream release supplies the payload; source verification
precedes the build.

The previous architecture put execution on a remote Argo cluster with FSDK
containers and a local registry mirror. That was wrong; the execution model
is pure GitHub Actions. No external build service, cluster, or self-hosted
runner is part of this path.

Copr, Packit-as-a-Service, Koji, Bodhi, Testing Farm, Kubernetes, local Zot,
lab nodes, and self-hosted runners are not dependencies.

## Tooling

The target runner is GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-26.04`. The x64 and arm images
entered public preview on 2026-06-11
([announcement](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-06-11-new-runner-images-in-public-preview/)
and [runner image issue](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/14226)).
For a public repository, the standard x64 runner provides 4 vCPUs, 16 GB of
RAM, 14 GB of SSD, and a six-hour job limit.

The current workflows still pin `ubuntu-24.04`. The migration to
`ubuntu-26.04` is outstanding; this document does not claim that it has
happened.

Package builds, generated-source reproduction, reproducibility probes, and
environment-sensitive validation run in GitHub Actions, in a container the
workflow starts with `docker run`.

**Which container is not what `AGENTS.md` says it is, and this is a live
contradiction rather than a nuance.** `AGENTS.md` requires the digest-pinned
`quay.io/packit/packit` image, and forbids replacing that digest with a
mutable tag. What actually builds every RPM is:

| workflow | container | pinned? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `build-stage.yml` — the binary lane | `quay.io/fedora/fedora:44` | no, a mutable tag |
| `rebuild-rpms.yml` — `preflight`, `precedence` | `quay.io/fedora/fedora:44` | no, a mutable tag |
| `packit-srpm-pilot.yml` — verification only, feeds nothing | `quay.io/packit/packit@sha256:8a178425…` | yes |
| `recalculate-hummingbird-gaps.yml` | `quay.io/hummingbird-community/bootc-os:latest` | no, a mutable tag |

So the only workflow honouring the rule is the one that produces nothing, and
the rule's own prohibition — a mutable tag — describes every real build.

The rule is not arbitrary and is not a leftover. `docs/superpowers/specs/`
carries an approved design in which Packit drives Mock, and the Packit image
was pinned precisely because it supplies `packit`, `mock` and `createrepo_c`
in one place. What the table shows is therefore an **unfinished
implementation**, not a wrong rule: the binary lane never got past hand-rolled
`rpmbuild` in a Fedora image. The mutable tag, the installed-but-unused mock,
and the hand-simulated build root are all the same gap seen from different
angles.

Whether to finish that design or supersede it is tracked in
[#43](https://github.com/projectbluefin/utah-packages/issues/43).

`.github/workflows/packit-srpm-pilot.yml` proves the SRPM path but is
verification-only and manual-dispatch-only: its full-inventory fan-out is not
a PR or merge check and its output is not published. Its `discover` job emits the package list from
`tools/packit_workflow.py packages`; its per-package `srpm` matrix has
`fail-fast: false` and is fanned out over chunks of 250 by
`tools/packit_workflow.py chunks`. The chunking is not cosmetic: GitHub caps a
matrix at 256 jobs and expands a larger one to nothing rather than rejecting
it, so once the monorepo passed 256 packages the pilot failed on every run with
a green `discover` above an `srpm` job that never existed. The `discover` guard
asserts the package list is non-empty, which a list of 402 satisfies while
still producing no jobs. Each matrix job uses `tools/source_pipeline.py` to fetch
and verify the configured sources and stage them beside the spec, then runs
`packit srpm --preserve-spec`. It uploads one SRPM artifact and stops there:
it does not feed the overlay or publication, and nothing consumes its output.

### What Packit is for here, and what it is not

Packit stays, scoped to what it is good at: **turning a recipe into an SRPM and
proving the spec is well formed.** Run against this monorepo it does that in
three or four seconds a package:

```text
flac-1.5.0-9.fc43      SRPM OK in 4s
libnice-0.1.23-3.fc43  SRPM OK in 4s
dracut-111-2.fc43      SRPM OK in 3s
```

That is worth having as a gate. A malformed spec fails in seconds rather than
after a build lane has installed a build root and compiled for minutes --
`dracut` sat behind a lowercase month in a `%changelog` date, the sort of thing
an SRPM step catches immediately.

Packit is **not** replacing the binary lane, and the disttags above say why.
`packit srpm` yields `flac-1.5.0-9.fc43`; this factory ships
`gnome-shell-extension-gsconnect-72-3.hum1.bfin`. The whole reason the factory
exists is to rebuild against Hummingbird so that sonames match the image it
feeds -- the staging work behind `libheif`, `abseil-cpp` and `ffmpeg` is
exactly that problem. A Fedora-chroot SRPM does not answer it.

**Copr is the shape in which Packit could take over the binary lane, and we are
not pursuing it now.** Packit builds binaries through `copr_build` jobs, and
Copr offers Fedora chroots; producing `hum1.bfin` RPMs would need a custom Copr
chroot carrying the Hummingbird repository, plus the exclusion rules the lane
scripts already encode (Fedora must not answer for what the factory rebuilds,
and one Hummingbird package must not answer for another -- see the ruby
default-gems conflict). That is a migration of the build root itself, not a
change of build driver. Recorded here so the option is not rediscovered from
scratch; tracked with the wider question in
[#43](https://github.com/projectbluefin/utah-packages/issues/43).

Two consequences worth stating plainly:

- Packit does not do source acquisition either. It logs *We are unable to
  download remote sources from spec-file ... skipping downloading of remote
  sources*, so `tools/source_pipeline.py` remains the only thing fetching and
  verifying upstream archives, in both lanes.
- `.packit.yaml` declares packages but carries **no `jobs:` section**, so the
  Packit service performs no work on a pull request. The manifest is a
  precondition for Copr builds, not evidence of them. The only thing exercising
  Packit is the pilot workflow.

The root Packit configuration and the source lock both cover all 402 recipes:

| check | result |
| --- | ---: |
| `ls -d packages/*/ \| wc -l` | `402` |
| entries under `.packit.yaml:packages` | `402` |
| entries under `config/upstream-sources.json:packages` | `402` |

`python3 tools/validate.py` reports:

```text
validated 402 source RPMs
```

## Current binary pipeline

`.github/workflows/rebuild-rpms.yml` is the current binary lane. Its
`prepare`, `preflight`, `precedence` and `publish` jobs, and the
`build-stage.yml` it calls, all run on `ubuntu-24.04`; the migration to
`ubuntu-26.04` remains open.

| job | verified behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `prepare` | Runs `rpmspec` over every recipe in the build root (`tools/extract_buildrequires.sh`) and solves the BuildRequires graph (`tools/build_graph.py`). Selects every package whose input digest differs from the one recorded on the published image (`tools/factory_state.py`), every stale published build, and the direct BuildRequires dependents of both; a full rebuild selects everything. Orders the selection into waves by longest path over the graph, a config `stage` only ordering the members of a cycle, and writes the plan with the reason for each package to the job summary. A chain deeper than the fourteen waves fails and names the package rather than dropping it. |
| `preflight` | Resolves BuildRequires for the selected packages with dnf in the real build root and uploads a worklist of unsatisfiable ones; it is `continue-on-error` and advisory. The graph that orders the waves comes from `prepare`. |
| `rebuild0` through `rebuild13` | Fourteen calls to the reusable `build-stage.yml`, one per wave, each a `fail-fast: false` package matrix. Each later wave downloads the artifacts of strictly earlier waves, creates a local `[stages]` dnf repository with `createrepo_c`, and resolves against it. |
| `precedence` | Checks that each produced RPM outranks what Fedora 44 and Hummingbird already offer, and reports any name Hummingbird also provides. A source package with a losing RPM is named in its `losers` output and kept out of the repository; it does not fail the job. |
| `publish` | Seeds from the verified previous image, replaces the RPMs of each source package this run built (and did not lose precedence) by source name, removes the bootstrap RPM, creates and signs repository metadata, validates the Hummingbird-only transaction over the whole candidate, and publishes a GHCR OCI image that is both cosign-signed and provenance-attested. A failed package keeps its previous build. |
| `report` | Runs whether or not publish did. Names every selected package that did not publish -- from the run's own artifact list -- in the job summary, and on `main` opens, updates or closes the tracking issue *Factory: packages failing on main*. |

91 of 402 packages carry a hand-assigned `stage` in
`config/upstream-sources.json`. Since waves are solved from BuildRequires it is
consulted only between members of one BuildRequires cycle, to decide which
builds first -- `malcontent-bootstrap` before `flatpak` before `malcontent`.
Elsewhere it is ignored; the solved order is twelve waves deep, where the hand
stages went to ten and had missed real edges.

`.github/workflows/build-stage.yml` is the wave itself, and the only place a
package is built. It takes a stage number and a JSON list of packages; it
knows nothing about the other waves beyond the artifacts they left behind.
Ordering lives entirely in the caller.

The five dependency stages pass their output between jobs as workflow
artifacts. A later stage downloads those artifacts into `work/prior`, creates
the local `[stages]` repository there, and uses that repository for the
transaction; the artifact handoff and the dnf repository are both part of
the dependency mechanism.

A package builds in the hermetic mock lane unless it declares `build_lane:
container`. `tools/hermetic_build.sh` renders the mock config
(`tools/mock_config.py`), lets `mock --calculate-build-dependencies` resolve
every BuildRequires into `buildroot_lock.json`, keys the package cache on the
locked NEVRAs, materializes the lock into a local repository and runs `mock
--hermetic-build` under `unshare --net`, as an unprivileged `mockbuilder`.
The lock, the mock config and its hash are uploaded per package
(`lock-s<N>-<pkg>`).

On the container lane, the workflow stages the verified source inside the
Fedora 44 container and runs `rpmbuild -br` to resolve generated
BuildRequires, followed by `rpmbuild -ba` to produce the binary RPMs.

### Incremental publication

Publication follows Fedora and Hummingbird: each good build goes into the
repository. The candidate is the previous published image, verified, with
every source package this run built replacing its own previous RPMs, by
source name so a dropped subpackage leaves with it. A package that failed to
build, or built but does not outrank Fedora or Hummingbird, keeps its
previous published build, or stays absent if it never had one.

What still gates the tag is the Hummingbird-only consumer transaction over the
whole candidate: it is what protects Utah. If the new set does not resolve,
the tag does not move, however many packages built. `tools/publish_gate.py`
decides the replacement (`assemble`), models the gate (`publish_allowed`) and
checks the publish job against both; `tests/test_incremental_publish.py`
drives them through each failure mode.

Publication happens as waves finish, not once at the end. After each wave
that has later waves still to come, `rebuild-rpms.yml` calls
`publish-repository.yml` for waves 0..k (`publish0`..`publish3`, the first four waves), and a final
call covers every wave. Each publication seeds from the image the previous
one pushed, which the witness check accepts because it carries this run's id,
and each is gated on its own Hummingbird-only transaction. An early one may
fail it -- a library whose soname moved publishes before its consumers are
rebuilt -- and then publishes nothing; only the final one fails the run. So a
one-line fix to a wave-0 library publishes when wave 0 finishes, not when the
slowest package in the same run does.

A second, advisory check follows it: what Utah actually installs. The gate's
contract is about 78 packages; Utah installs about 120 -- Bluefin's
`[fedora]` and `[fedora_v44]` plus Utah's `[gnome]`, `[parity]`, `[hardware]`,
`[services]` and `[build]`, minus `[unavailable]`. `tools/utah_install_set.py`
computes that set with Utah's own `scripts/install-packages.py`, fetched from
Utah's `main` with its repository files, and resolves it in the Hummingbird
base image against the candidate plus Hummingbird, naming every package that
does not resolve. It warns rather than blocks, so one gap cannot freeze every
other package: the job summary lists them, and on `main` the report job keeps
one *Utah install set: <package> does not resolve* issue per package, closing
each on the first run in which it resolves.

It used to be atomic: one failed package held back every other one, and over
four weeks 3 of 117 full runs published while one flaky `fish` test blocked
everything behind it.

### Preserving completed package builds

Each successful package build is also written immediately to a
content-keyed OCI cache, so a later run can restore completed RPMs even when
the earlier run never published a repository. Restored RPMs follow the same
stage-artifact and final-gate path as freshly compiled RPMs.

The key binds the recipe, prepared build-root digest, prepare-time factory
digest, resolved build-root NEVRAs and disttag. Rebuild planning remains
authoritative: directly changed and stale packages are excluded from reuse.
The full rationale and invariants are in
[`docs/skills/package-build-cache.md`](skills/package-build-cache.md).

### Triggers: incremental on merge, daily retry, weekly full

| trigger | builds |
| --- | --- |
| push to `main` touching `packages/**` or `config/**` | what changed since the published image, plus its direct BuildRequires dependents |
| daily, `03:17 UTC` | the same, plus every package whose last attempt failed |
| weekly, Sunday `01:23 UTC` | everything, against the cache |
| dispatch | the same as daily, or everything with `full` |

What changed is read from the `org.projectbluefin.factory.state` label on the
published image: the input digest of every build in it -- recipe files,
inventory entry, build-root pin and Hummingbird repository. A git diff from
the previous push cannot answer that once runs queue, and a NEVR comparison
misses a recipe fix that does not move the release. An image without the
label (the first run after this landed) falls back to both.

Runs on one ref are serialized and never cancelled: GitHub keeps one run
pending and replaces an older pending run with a newer one, which is safe
because the newer run selects against the published state and so builds the
union. The daily run moved off `06:41 UTC`, where it collided with
`bump-upstream-sources.yml`; a merged bump now builds through the push
trigger. Pull requests run validation and the canary, never the factory.
The rationale is part of the cache contract in
[`docs/skills/package-build-cache.md`](skills/package-build-cache.md#triggers-queueing-and-batching).

### The pipeline canary

`.github/workflows/canary.yml` proves a pipeline change in minutes instead of
hours into a full run. It calls `rebuild-rpms.yml` itself through
`workflow_call`, so it runs the real jobs, over a fixed set: `libical` and
`vulkan-headers` at stage 0 and `vulkan-loader` at stage 4, which
BuildRequires `vulkan-headers = %{version}` -- only stage 0's output satisfies
it. Every source in the set is on the Fedora lookaside, so the canary fails on
the pipeline and not on a flaky upstream host.

| pass | what it proves |
| --- | --- |
| `pass1` | The set builds, passes precedence and a Hummingbird-only transaction over every binary it produced, and publishes, signs and attests `utah-packages:canary-<pr>`. Never `latest`. `verify-publish` then reads that digest with Utah's own `scripts/check-repo-availability.py`, fetched from Utah's `main`, asserts two layers with repodata first, and verifies the signature and provenance. |
| `pass2` | The same set again compiles nothing: every build is a cache hit, so the key is stable from one run to the next. |
| `pass3` | The same set plus `python-typing-inspection` with its recipe perturbed in the checkout: that one compiles and every other package still hits, so one package's change does not invalidate the cache wholesale. |

The cache is salted with a digest of the build path (`tools/canary.py
salt`), so a change to how packages are compiled compiles for real in
`pass1`, and any other change reuses the previous canary's builds. Canary
entries never share a key with production ones: an empty salt leaves the
production key unchanged, which `tests/test_package_cache_key.py` asserts.

It runs on every pull request. The `Canary` job is the required check and
passes without building anything when no pipeline path changed
(`.github/workflows/`, `.github/actions/`, `tools/`, `config/`,
`Containerfile*`). Do not dispatch a full run to prove a pipeline change
before the canary is green on it.

It is not a mock build, and this is the most misleading thing about the file:
`build-stage.yml` installs `mock` and never invokes it, then hand-simulates
what mock would have set up. Its own comments say so — *"mirroring Hummingbird
mock.cfg"*, *"the plain fedora image is not a build root: it lacks the group
mock installs"*, *"mock defines USER in its build root; a bare container does
not"*. So there is no clean root per build, no hermetic mode, and no reset
between packages. Moving to real mock is agreed and unbuilt; see below.

## Repository gates

The repository gates are enforced across CI workflows and collected in `Justfile`:

| Gate | Command | Enforced in | What it gates |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Factory onboarding contract | `tools/factory_contract.py` | `.github/workflows/validate.yml` | Skill router coverage, skill front-matter, the `AGENTS.md` self-improvement mandate, the pinned `projectbluefin/common` sidecar, banned changelog and session-notes files, and relative documentation links |
| Package factory configuration | `tools/validate.py` | `.github/workflows/validate.yml` | Import provenance in `.hummingbird-upstream.json`, source-lock coverage, and Packit configuration for every recipe |
| Workflow shell quoting | `tools/check_workflow_quoting.py` | `.github/workflows/rebuild-rpms.yml` (`prepare`) | Shell-quoting safety of build scripts embedded in GitHub Actions workflows |
| Runtime contract | `tools/runtime_contract.py config/bluefin-packages.toml config/runtime-contract.toml --check` | `.github/workflows/rebuild-rpms.yml` (`prepare`) | Image manifest resolution against the pinned Hummingbird runtime contract |
| Unit tests | `pytest tests` / `unittest discover` | `.github/workflows/validate.yml`, `.github/workflows/rebuild-rpms.yml` (`prepare`) | The tooling in `tools/`, including `tools/publish_gate.py`, whose regression test asserts the rebuild-rpms.yml publish job replaces only what a run built, keeps a failed or precedence-losing package at its previous build, and never publishes a candidate whose Hummingbird-only transaction does not resolve |

`just check` runs all five gates (`factory-check`, `validate`, `workflow-quoting`,
`runtime-contract`, `test`), and `tests/test_gate_catalog.py` structurally
asserts that the documented local gate and CI agree on the enforced gate set in
both directions. `just test` remains available to run the test suite on its own,
and `pre-commit run --all-files` adds YAML, JSON, and TOML hygiene plus
actionlint and the SHA-pinning rule for third-party actions. None of these
publish anything; publication gates live in the rebuild and compose workflows.

## Agreed direction, not yet built

Recorded from a design review against Hummingbird's own factory. The sections
above describe what the workflows do; everything below is decided and unbuilt.
Each row states the decision and the evidence that motivated it, so a later
reader can tell a considered choice from an accident. Decisions that have since
been implemented are described above, in the present tense, rather than kept
here as a list of completed work.

| Decision | Today | Agreed | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope** | "the desktop stack Hummingbird does not ship" | Everything above the base OS that Bluefin's contract needs; never Hummingbird's toolchain | Utah is Bluefin recreated on Hummingbird, and we package it ourselves. Owning an ABI inside a six-hour runner is not a job worth taking from people who do it well. |
| **Hummingbird overlap** | `precedence` reports any shared package name as a mistake | Allowed, but declared per package in `config/upstream-sources.json` | A general factory legitimately rebuilds things Hummingbird also ships. Undeclared overlap is still a mistake. |
| **Build engine** | The hermetic mock lane by default (`backend: hermetic`); packages with `build_lane: container` in `config/upstream-sources.json` stay on the hand-built container root, each with a `build_lane_reason` | Mock, hermetic | Built. The container lane reimplemented mock by hand (*"mirroring Hummingbird mock.cfg"*, *"mock defines USER in its build root; a bare container does not"*). It remains for declared exceptions -- none yet: a 24-package subset (Rust and Python with generated BuildRequires, meson/cmake C, `%check`-heavy git, fish, flac, libratbag, pipewire) built on the hermetic lane -- and the canary's `pass6` keeps it proven. Whether Packit drives mock is still [#43](https://github.com/projectbluefin/utah-packages/issues/43). |
| **Buildroot** | Solved live against whatever the repos serve at that moment, except on the hermetic lane | Resolve once, write `buildroot_lock.json` as a run artifact, build offline from it | Built as the hermetic lane (`tools/hermetic_build.sh`): `mock --calculate-build-dependencies` resolves every BuildRequires, dynamic ones included, into `buildroot_lock.json`, which records EVR, arch, URL and header digest per package and the bootstrap image by digest; the lock is materialized into a local repository and the build runs under `unshare --net`. The lock is uploaded per package (`lock-s<N>-<pkg>`) and is the cache key's root. Hummingbird's `ci/build_rpms.sh --hermetic` is the same mechanism. |
| **Compiler cache** | `sccache` against the Actions cache service, over the network | Mock's `ccache` plugin plus `actions/cache`; delete `.github/actions/setup-sccache` | Hermetic mock is network-isolated. sccache would degrade to a total miss and look like "builds got slower" rather than failing. |
| **Architecture** | `x86_64` hardcoded in the Hummingbird repository id and the sccache URL | Stay x86_64 only | Deferred deliberately, not overlooked. |
| **Fork state** | `.hummingbird-upstream.json` pins a Fedora commit and tree; drift is invisible | Compute drift against the pinned commit in CI; an undeclared diff fails | Hummingbird labels every package `clean`, `modified` or `independent` and requires a reason for `modified`. Computed rather than declared, so it cannot rot the way the stage integers did. The recorded `tree` cannot be recomputed offline: the import drops files dist-git carries, so pango records tree `bdf8be16` while its three imported files hash to `f80aca67`, the difference being `.gitignore`. Drift detection has to fetch the pinned commit rather than rehash the working tree. |
| **Ship the lock** | The published image contains only `repository/` | Ship `buildroot_lock.json` inside it beside the RPMs | Provenance now records what built the image; the lock is what records what went into the packages. Waits on the lockfile above. |
| **Tooling shape** | 14 scripts in `tools/`, plus workflows that hand-edit config | One authoritative CLI | Hummingbird's `ci/dist_git.py` owns import, update, sync, rebuild, rename and metadata. Their single most transferable practice. |

These rows are a design review's conclusions, and one of them collides with an
already-approved design: `docs/superpowers/specs/` describes a Packit-driven
Mock factory approved by the maintainer, which this review did not account for.
Both agree the build belongs in mock. They differ on whether Packit drives it,
and that difference decides the build container and the fate of roughly 1,445
lines of Packit configuration and tooling. It is
[#43](https://github.com/projectbluefin/utah-packages/issues/43), and nothing
here acts on it.
