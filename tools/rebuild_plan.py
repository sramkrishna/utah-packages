"""Decide which recipes a rebuild has to build, and in which wave.

This was an inline heredoc in .github/workflows/rebuild-rpms.yml, which meant
the one decision that can silently ship an incomplete repository had no tests.
It lives here so it does.

Two rules govern the skip, both taken from how Packit decides whether its own
work is already done:

**A skip needs two witnesses that agree.** Packit's
`should_archives_be_uploaded_to_lookaside` (packit/api.py) uploads unless the
archive is in the remote lookaside cache *and* recorded in the local `sources`
file -- `if not in_cache or not in_sources_file: return True`. One witness is
not enough, and disagreement means do the work. This factory learned the same
thing the hard way: `prepare` skipped what the published repository carried,
while the build root only saw the repositories it was actually given, and
pipewire-libs-extra failed on `pkgconfig(libfreeaptx)` with libfreeaptx-devel
sitting published and skipped. So the published listing only counts as a
witness when the build root will really have that repository enabled, which is
what `factory_repo` says here.

**Compare the whole NEVR, not the name and version.** Packit checks presence by
filename *and* content hash (`is_archive_uploaded`, packit/utils/lookaside.py,
"the same approach fedpkg itself uses") and decides whether an update is needed
by comparing NVRs in a Koji tag, not versions. Comparing only name and version
here missed a recipe whose `Release:` moved while its `Version:` stood still --
a spec fix or an added patch -- which the git diff catches on a push but not on
the nightly schedule, where there is no diff range to read at all.

    libavcodec.so.62; once ffmpeg 9 is published and provides .so.63, nothing
    satisfies the old binary and the consumer transaction fails on it. The
    same happens when Hummingbird bumps a soname underneath the factory.

    Neither the recipe nor the inventory changed, so `changed` never sees it,

    root, which is the only cure.

    Skipped, to avoid calling healthy packages stale on a partial view:

    something provides libavcodec.so.63. That is what a rebuild repairs.

    pkgconfig(xproto) from a -devel or MinGW subpackage, all of which

    rebuilding, so calling it stale rebuilt the same 80 packages, and their
