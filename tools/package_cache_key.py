"""The tag under which one package's built RPMs are cached.

The factory's only skip mechanism is the published consumer repository, and
publication is atomic: it needs every stage, plus precedence, plus the
Hummingbird-only transaction. So a failing gate freezes the witness, and
everything outside it rebuilds from scratch on every run. The witness has been
at 67 packages since 2026-08-30; webkitgtk, which is not in it, built 20
times on 19 September alone at 182 minutes a build, with byte-identical inputs
(issue #177).

This is the other half of the answer, modelled on projectbluefin/utah's
scripts/kernel-cache-tag.sh: a cache that answers "have we already built this
exact thing", kept strictly separate from "is the repository coherent enough to
install from". Nothing installs from the cache. Only tools/rebuild_plan.py reads
it, and a hit is materialised as this stage's ordinary artifact, so precedence,
the transaction check and publish see an identical repository either way. That
property is what makes a hit safe to trust: it changes how the RPMs were
obtained, never what the run validates.

Why keying on the recipe alone would be wrong
---------------------------------------------
A stage-5 package builds in a root containing earlier stages' fresh output. A
key over the spec alone would hand back an RPM linked against different
libraries than this run produced -- precisely the incoherence the publish gate
exists to catch, arriving through the cache instead. So the resolved build root
is part of the key, and the key is therefore computed *after* dnf has resolved
builddep rather than before. That costs the resolution (about a minute) and
saves the compile.

Why the chain holds across stages
---------------------------------
It only works if an unchanged recipe yields an unchanged NEVR, or every stage's
resolved root would differ from the last run's and nothing would ever hit. It
does: many specs use %autorelease, which rpmautospec derives from the
committed packages/<name>/changelog and not from a build counter. Confirmed
empirically -- libical-3.0.20-1.hum1.bfin came out with the identical NEVR in
run 35413902261 and run 35445712318, twelve hours and many commits apart.

Hashing whole files, comments included, is deliberate, for the reason
kernel-cache-tag.sh gives: it can only ever rebuild something that did not need
rebuilding, never reuse something stale.
