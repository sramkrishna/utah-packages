"""Repository-wide package inventory: the single enforceable contract.

Every factory task consumes :func:`inventory` instead of rescanning
``packages/``, ``config/upstream-sources.json``, or ``.packit.yaml`` on its
own. Consumers that need lock-entry fields (``sha512``, ``filename``,
``dist_bump``, ``dist_git_name``, ...) take them from :func:`source_locks`,
which shares the same validation -- the lock file is parsed exactly once,
here. The inventory refuses ambiguous state outright: duplicate spec
directories, duplicate source locks, unknown stages, or multiple specs per
package are contract violations, not warnings.
